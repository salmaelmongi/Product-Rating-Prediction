# Product-Rating-Prediction

**Problem Statement:**


Wish.com Product Rating Prediction is a data science project that attempts to predict product ratings on the Wish.com e-commerce platform. Wish.com has a diverse product offering, and understanding what aspects drive product evaluations can be beneficial to both buyers and merchants. This project's dataset includes product information and user reviews with ratings ranging from 1 to 5. The better the product rating, the more satisfied customers are. The idea is to use machine learning models to forecast product ratings based on product attributes and user feedback.

**Description:**


The data is a tabular dataset that may require data preprocessing, depending on the models you choose to employ. The dataset consists of Wish.com product data mixed with publicly available information. Because the dataset contains some noise, data preparation is an important stage in the study. The goal is to assist sellers in anticipating the anticipated reception of their products on Wish.com without the requirement for actual listings by forecasting product ratings. This analysis can also provide significant insights into the conditions under which a product is likely to obtain good ratings, revealing light on Wish.com's consumer base and assisting merchants in making informed judgments about their product offers. The dataset contains ratings ranging from 1 to 5, and the analysis seeks to find patterns and correlations that influence these evaluations.
